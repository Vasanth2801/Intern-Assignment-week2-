Task : To implement a new feature in the prototype game 

What I have Added:
* I have a added Traps for the game like rotating blade,fire trap and spikes
* I have added powerups for the game like helath recovery when health goes down we can use it regain the health
* I have added a camerashakeeffect for certain events 

Why I have chose it :
* For the traps yesterday after completing the task game was just enemy and player if player shoots them the enemy destorys and enemy goes away and player picks the coins easily 
  but it has to not that easy to balance the game i have came up with the idea to create the traps for the player to escape  always be headsup in the game
* Since we have adding the traps it will have the ability to slow down the player and reduce the health so we need a way to regain the health we will add the powerup so player cant be      always complaining about the game and there is way to restore the health even though if they came up sudden unaviodable obstacles the health goes down
* Now even though the we have traps and powerups for the game but the sometimes the feel come with the special effects of some simple touch make the game even good.So i came with the       camershake effects for that good touch 

How does it improve Gameplay effects:
* For improving the gameplay and keep the player engaging for the game i have some traps even though they are enemies in the game that alone cant make them game engaging and also
  in this one we can kill the enemy with the bullets when all the are killed then there is nothing left for enemy to stop.
* So we have created the traps for the player to keep engaging and always keep the player on thier guard up in each and every move and now we have traps to stop the player we have to add   some powerup for the player
* Now the traps keep on reduce the player and goes zero it will frustate the player and we have to add the power up for the player to add some health so that even the traps become          unavoidable we have power up to health.So that player can find a way to bounce back in the game
* Now everything in the place butstill a simple touch may add it even more feel for the player.So i have added a camerashake effect when player collidies with enemy to get the effect of    danger feeling 

Summary:
* From today i have learned the importance of the game mechanics in every game. From today even when I play games i will analyse what are the game mechanics and try to undrstand and implement it myself
